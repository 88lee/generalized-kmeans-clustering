/**
 * A KMeans implementation that tracks which clusters moved and which points are assigned to which
 * clusters and the distance to the closest cluster.
 *
 *
 * We maintain for each point two assignments: 1) its current assignment and 2) its previous
 * assignment. With this data, we can determine if a point moves between assignments by comparing
 * the assignments.
 *
 * We maintain for each cluster its index, generation number, centroid.
 *
 * The invariants are:
 *
 * 1) each cluster is assigned a generation number
 * 2) generation numbers are monotonically increasing
 * 3) all clusters whose centroids change in one Lloyd's round are assigned the same generation number
 * 4) when the membership of a cluster changes, the generation number of the cluster is increased
 * 5) each point is assigned the index of the cluster that is a member of
 *
 * Initial condition:
 *
 * 1) Initial cluster centroids are provided. All clusters are assigned generation -1 with the
 * provided cluster centroids.
 * 2) All points are assigned to the sentinel cluster (index == -1) with generation
 * -2.
 * 3) (Some) points are re-assigned to (non-sentinel) clusters, resulting in the setting of the
 * generation number of those points to -1.
 * 4) The current round is set to 0.
 *
 *
 * Lloyd's algorithm can be stated as:
 *
 * 0) Increase the round
 *
 * 1) If any points were re-assigned (change in generation number), then update the clusters
 * impacted by the re-assignment:
 * a) Compute the new cluster centroids for the out-dated clusters.
 * b) Set the generation of the clusters affect to be the value of the round
 *
 * 2) Increase the round
 *
 * 3) If any centers were updated, then update the assignments of the points:
 * a) For each point (or a random sub-set of the points), identify the closest cluster.
 * b) If the closest cluster has a different index or generation number, then update the
 * assignments of the point so that its index is the index of the cluster to which it is assigned
 * and the generation is the round the new assignment is made.
